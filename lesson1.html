            <p>
                Imagine a record book where every entry is locked by a specialized code so it can't be changed without permission or falsified. Everyone has access to this record book, and when new entries or "blocks" are entered, people can check to ensure each entry is correct and fair. This is blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blockchain is a digital, decentralized ledger that records transactions across multiple systems. Everyone can access it, but its structure prevents unauthorized modifications or fraudulent entries. Each entry is a record block appended to the previous information block and uses a complex cryptographic hash (a fixed-size string of numbers) that's currently tamper-proof.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's the foundation of cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and some digital products. It allows transactions to happen online with no physical proof, but the unbreakable hash verifies the integrity of each block in the record.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working with blockchain opens up a variety of positions in security and contracts. As more industries begin to use it to verify products and agreements, this may translate to more job opportunities.

        <h1>Lesson 2: Use of Blockchain</h1>

        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p>
                Blockchain technology has evolved far beyond cryptocurrencies. Today, it is used in various industries such as healthcare, logistics, and even voting systems. Its key feature is decentralization, meaning it doesn't rely on a central authority to validate transactions, but instead, all participants in the network help verify the accuracy of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                In healthcare, blockchain is being used to secure medical records, ensuring privacy while allowing authorized users to access the information they need. In supply chains, blockchain helps track the origin of goods, reducing fraud and improving transparency. In the future, we may see blockchain used for secure voting, ensuring that every vote is counted accurately and securely.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using blockchain, organizations can significantly reduce costs related to intermediaries, increase transparency, and build trust with consumers and partners.

    <!-- Lesson 3 Content -->
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Lesson 3: Blockchain in Cryptocurrency</h1>

        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p>
                One of the most famous applications of blockchain technology is in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain provides the decentralized and secure infrastructure needed for digital currencies to function without the need for a central bank or authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the world of cryptocurrency, each transaction is recorded in a blockchain ledger, ensuring that the sender has the required funds and that the transaction is legitimate. Every transaction is verified by multiple participants in the network, known as miners, who use powerful computers to solve complex algorithms to confirm transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blockchain's transparency and security features make it ideal for cryptocurrencies. Without blockchain, cryptocurrencies would be susceptible to fraud and double-spending. This is why blockchain is seen as the backbone of digital currency ecosystems and has opened the door for numerous other applications in finance.
